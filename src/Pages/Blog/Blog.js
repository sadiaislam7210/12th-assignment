  How will you improve the performance of a React Application?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>Optimizing application performance is key for developers who are conscious of keeping the user experience in an app and keeping them positive. According to Akamai's research, a second delay in load time could result in a 7 percent reduction in conversions, making it essential for developers to create apps with optimized performance. In responsive applications, we ensure a very fast UI by default However, as an application grows, developers may experience some performance issues. In this guide, we will discuss five important ways to optimize the performance of a responsive application, including pre-optimization strategies.</p>

    <p>What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?
There are several ways to manage a React application. Local state, Global state, Server state, and URL state are some of them. A local state is probably the easiest type of state to handle feedback, considering that many tools have been created in the original feedback library to handle it. useState is the first tool you need to reach to manage the status of your component. It can accept any valid data value, including primitive and object values. Additionally, its setter function can be passed to other components as a callback function (without the need for optimization such as callback).</p>

  How does prototypical inheritance work?
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>Prototypeal inheritance is a feature of JavaScript that is used to add methods and features to objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, to get and set an [[prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object. JavaScript, as mentioned above, is capable of having function properties. All functions have a special property called prototype. Please note that the code below is free-standing (it is safe to assume that there is no JavaScript on the webpage other than the code below). For the best learning experience, it is highly recommended that you open a console, navigate to the "Console" tab, copy and paste the JavaScript code below, and run it by pressing the Enter / Return key.</p>

    <p>You have an array of products. Each product has a name, price, description, etc. How will you implement a search to find products by name?
Let's take a look at nine easy ways to persuade visitors to your online store with product descriptions that are sold. When you write a product description with a huge crowd of buyers in mind, your description becomes intentional and you do not address anyone. The best product descriptions address your target audience directly and personally. You ask questions and answer them as if you were having a conversation with them. You choose the word using your ideal buyer. You use the word you. When we sell our own products, we get excited about the specific product features and specifications. We live and breathe our company, our website and our products. The problem is that our potential buyers are less interested in worldly features and spectacles. They want to know what it means for them how it will solve their biggest problems. For this you need to highlight the benefits of each feature. When we are stuck for words and do not know what else to add to our product descriptions, we often add something as humble as "excellent product quality". This is a yes, yes phrase. As soon as a potential buyer reads the quality of the excellent product he thinks, yes, yes, of course; Everyone says it. Ever heard of someone describing the quality of their products as average, not so good, even bad?</p>

  What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
  </div>
  <div class="collapse-content"> 
    <p>Unit tests are usually automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a part of an application (known as a "unit") meets the design and behaves accordingly. In systematic programming, a unit may be a complete module, but it is usually a separate function or method. In object-oriented programming, a unit is often a complete interface, such as a class, or an individual method. By writing tests first for the smallest testable units, then compound behavior among them, one can create comprehensive tests for complex applications. To isolate the problems that arise, each test should be tested independently. Alternatives such as method stubs, mock objects, [4] duplicates and test harnesses can be used to help test a module in isolation. During development, a software developer may code test criteria or results that are well known to verify the accuracy of the unit. During test case execution, framework log tests fail any criteria and report in a summary. For this, the most commonly used method is test-function - the expected value. Unit tests can be written and maintained quickly using parametricized tests. These allow multiple tests to be performed multiple times with different input sets, thus reducing the copy of the test code. Unlike traditional unit tests, which are usually closed procedures and tests are unchanging, parameterized tests take any set of parameters. The parameterized tests are supported by TestNG, JUnit and its .Net replica XUnit. Suitable parameters for unit testing can be provided manually or in some cases created automatically by the test structure. In recent years support has been added for more robust (unit) test writing, utilizing the concept of theory, test cases that run the same steps but using test data created at runtime, as opposed to regular parameterized tests that use the same execution steps with input sets.
